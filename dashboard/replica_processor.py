    DESCRIPTION:
        Moves the runs from the source_path to a series of batch folders --batch folders each contain 20 runs per batch. 
        The reason for this is because processing these all at once requires holding too much data in memory before

    NOTE:
        The source_path parameter MUST contain a / at the end.
        
        Also, after running this, if you get an error saying mv did not work. Check the directory you set as the source path and determine the number of batches it generated then rerun
        this function with the same parameters except batches_we_currently_have_in_folder now equals however many batches it generated with the first run.
